You can have updates to your site automatically send details to your 
Twitter account. All you'll need to do is provide your account information 
in the Radiant::Config settings.

The required keys are `twitter.password`, `twitter.username` and `twitter.url_host`.

On the edit screen of each page, you can select the option to notify Twitter
of all of the updates to the children of that page. You can create a blog page,
for example, and have each new post linked in your Twitter account.
